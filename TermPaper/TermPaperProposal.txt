Abstract:
APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. 
Web development involves various APIs, it is important to choose the right Architectural style for these APIs.
In this Term paper, a comparison will be made on different API Architectures that are widely used. 
The properties of the API, its pros and cons and their application in real world solutions will be compared. 
Some of the API style that will be studied are REST, SOAP and GraphQL, etc. 
This comparative analysis can aid and assist in choosing the right API architecture when designing solutions on the web.
