Project title: Web Application to find restaurants based on food allergies or intolerances and location

Project Description: 
There are many who suffer from food intolerance and allergies around us, yet there is no simple solution to find restaurants that have food options that cater to these dietary restrictions. 
This can be increasingly frustrating and inconvenient to individuals who deal with these intolerances/allergies. 
Hence, we came up with the idea of “DineSafe”. 
It is a webpage that uses  restaurant menu data to find nearby restaurants based on food allergies or intolerances. 
Our objective is to provide a user-friendly and convenient guide based on allergy filters. 
This can additionally benefit individuals who are on dietary restriction for other reasons too.
